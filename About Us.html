    <h1>Welcome to Kid-zone</h1>
    <p>
      A school with a true heart and soul. Our programs incorporate dynamic
      classroom instruction with caring, qualified teachers and enriching indoor
      and outdoor play experiences. We know that these first experiences within
      a school setting will have a long lasting impact on children’s future
      learning.

      <h2>PHILOSOPHY</h2>
      <p class="philosophy">
        We embrace a philosophy of education that combines a nurturing,
        inclusive learning environment with an increasingly challenging academic
        program that addresses the developmental needs of each child.
      </p>
        <p class="philosophy">
        In
        addition to academics – social and emotional well-being also plays a
        significant role in a child’s development. Our curriculum, various
        activities, and daily experiences provide children with opportunities
        for a fun, enriching and exciting time while they make long lasting
        relationships. We create a positive environment which encourages
        children to explore their surroundings on a daily basis. Upon completion
        of our program, we believe that your child’s well-rounded experiences
        will provide them the necessary strengths for emotional, social,
        cognitive, gross/fine motor, and academic excellence.
      </p>

      <h2>DIVERSITY</h2>
      <p class="diversity">
        <strong>Kid-zone</strong> commitment to diversity is integral to the
        mission of the school. The different perspectives and experiences of our
        families define the fabric of our community. These many perspectives and
        experiences contribute to the growth of each child and help form their
        vision of the world.
      </p>
        <p class="diversity">
        The vibrancy and vitality we feel at Kid-zone comes
        from the people who are here. At its root are the varied interests and
        experiences, the different backgrounds, cultures, religions, views, and
        perspectives that our children, staff and families bring to the school.
        Each of us adds to the richness of another’s experience. Working,
        learning and playing together teaches us lifelong lessons about
        appreciating each other, about knowing and understanding each other,
        about learning from each other.

      <h2>A HISTORY OF EXCELLENCE</h2>
      <p class="diversity">
        For over 35 years Turtle Rock Preschool has started children off on a
        lifetime of learning in a nurturing educational environment where each
        child feels happy, respected, proud, secure and loved. Ours was the
        first school in Irvine to attain elite accreditation by the National
        Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC). Since then we
        have maintained continuous accreditation by meeting all ten Early
        Childhood Program Standards – with over 400 individual criteria.</p>
        <p class="diversity">
        This
        history has culminated in an organization that provides children and
        families the individual attention they need while providing world-class
        resources and an extensive scope of early childhood programs. Turtle
        Rock provides an experience that few schools can match: from our
        Preschool children corresponding with President Obama to providing
        state-of-the-art learning facilities for our Kindergarteners to offering
        multiple community-wide events each year.
